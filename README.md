# Bike Lane Detector

This project was conducted throughout Data Acquisition and Analysis course at TUE. Its goal was to design a bike lane detector distinguishing between high quality, smooth bike road, and rough unpleasent one based on smartphone accelerometer data. Part 1a focused on data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction as well as principle component analisys (PCA) and Independent component analysis (ICA). Part 1b included data analisys with K-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM).
