# Bike Lane Detector

This project was conducted during the Data Acquisition and Analysis course at TU/e. Its goal was to design a bike lane detector capable of distinguishing between high-quality, smooth bike roads and rough, unpleasant ones using smartphone data.

Part 1a focused on data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
Part 1b involved data analysis using K-means clustering, Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

Smooth abd bumpy bike lanes:
